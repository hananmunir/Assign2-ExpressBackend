# Assign2-ExpressBackend
This is an API for travel agency. It is deployed on heroku and the link is https://assign2-express-backend.herokuapp.com/api/posts

# Notes
You cannot delete or update the posts using deployed link because I have removed that part so people dont delete the posts as a joke. I know there is still a way for them 
to delete these posts but this is just a dummy api so...
